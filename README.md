# TwO-O-Player Math Game
## Project description
An OOP-based command-line application built with Ruby in about 2 hours (including planning). This is an assignment for Lighouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp on week 9 day 1 (The 4th day of starting to learn Ruby).

The application is a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

## Getting started
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. (Optional) Open `main.rb` and change the players name on line 5 and 6.
3. Start running the game using the `ruby main.rb` command.
